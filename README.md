- PRs can be made to participating public repos on GitHub, those that have the Hacktoberfest topic. 

- Your PR should be labeled hacktoberfest-accepted and should be merged by the maintainer. 

- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam/invalid, it will not be counted. Any user with two or more spammy PRs will be disqualified.
